# ApkCenter Admin Panel DEPRECATED

This is the panel where the admin can `add/edit/delete` applications and categories.
- window that shows the requested apps that the user wants to have.
- window that shows the errors the apkcenter app have on the user side

TODOS:
- Make Languages more flexible (add/edit/delete)
- Add more websites to auto fill from
- Auto Fill Add Application window when requested app display is visible 
- Delete Application with auto fill of matched server applications
